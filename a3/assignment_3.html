        <h3 class="heading-4">Reflection:</h3>
        <p class="p-regular">From my visualizations, I noticed that action games seem to be the most popular and
          successful in terms of global sales across most platforms. Most notably, they are poplar among PS2, PS3, and
          XBox 360, platforms that have the highest total amount of global sales. It's interesting that popular home
          video game consoles, like PlayStation and XBox are most popular in action games, while handheld platforms,
          like the DS and Wii are popular in miscellaneous games, sports games, and other genres. This makes me think
          that a genre's success on a certain platform is correlated with the context that the platforms are used in,
          like collaborative/party settings, solo games, and multiplayer games.</p>

          Visualization 2: Sales Over Time by Platform and Genre

          Question 1: When did game sales, across all platforms and genres, peak in popularity?</h3>

        <h3 class="heading-4">
          Question 2: When did each platform's sales peak over time?
        </h3>
        <div id="vis6"></div>
        <h3 class="heading-4">How have video game sales changed for different platforms, genres, and publishers?:</h3>
        <p class="p-regular">It's clear that by looking at the visualizations, I can tell that the popularity of
          different genres and platforms change over time. While most genres maintain some relevance over the years, the
          sales of certain platforms decline, then drop over time as the technology becomes outdated and obsolete. There
          is no singular platform that has been and stayed popular forever, because new generations of it emerge and
          some become obsolete. For example, the PlayStation2 peaked sales in 2004, having the most sales of any plaform
          recorded. Over time, by 2010, global sales have declined from over 211 million to just 5.63 million. Looking
          at the data, it's interesting to see how the popularity of certain genres overlaps with certain platforms. For
          example, as shooter games peaked in 2011, PC and PS3 sales also peaked, leading me to believe that the release
          of shooter games, like Call of Duty 3 and Battlefield 3, being available on PC and PS3, lead to increased
          sales of these platforms.</p>
           <p class="p-regular">Overall, both genre and platform sales are correlated with one another. </p>
